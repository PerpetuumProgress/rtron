# OpenDRIVE-CityGML Duality

The conceptual data models of OpenDRIVE and CityGML meet requirements from different application domains—automotive and 3D GIS [1].
However, the challenges in one domain have already been addressed in the other.
Thus, the concept of the OpenDRIVE-CityGML Duality is being proposed:
With a consistent road space model in both OpenDRIVE and CityGML, the tools from both domains can be applied [2].

Different tools support different model formats.
With transformation tools such as [FME](https://www.safe.com/fme/), application-specific target formats can be generated based on CityGML.
The dual representation enables the usage of generic attributes and Application Domain Extensions (ADEs) of CityGML.
