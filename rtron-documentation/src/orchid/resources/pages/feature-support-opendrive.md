# Feature Support of OpenDRIVE

In the following a list of OpenDRIVE features supported by r:trÃ¥n is provided.
The new Transportation module of CityGML 3.0 will enable a range of new functions including the representation of traffic spaces together with lane topologies [[1](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9100603), [2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41064-020-00095-z)].

## Datasets

Tools and applications often implement and interpret the OpenDRIVE standard in (slightly) different ways.
For this reason, r:trÃ¥n is tested with the widest variety of OpenDRIVE datasets available.
This list currently includes datasets originating from the following organizations and implementations:

- Standardization organization: [Association of Standardization of Automation and Measuring Systems (ASAM)](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opendrive/)
- Surveying companies
    - [3D Mapping Solutions](https://www.3d-mapping.de/en/)
    - [Atlatec](https://www.atlatec.de/)
- Editors
    - [Road Network Editor (ROD)](https://www.mscsoftware.com/product/virtual-test-drive) of Vires
    - [RoadRunner](https://mathworks.com/products/roadrunner.html) of MathWorks
    - [Trian3DBuilder](https://trian3dbuilder.de/) of TrianGraphics
    - [ODDLOT](https://www.hlrs.de/solutions-services/service-portfolio/visualization/driving-simulator/oddlot/) of HLRS
