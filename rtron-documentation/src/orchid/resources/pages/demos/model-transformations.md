# Model Transformations

Create model derivatives using [FME workbenches](https://www.safe.com/fme/):

![FME Workbench](/assets/media/demos/model-transformations-fme-workbench.png)

This workbench reads a transformed OpenDRIVE dataset and creates:
* a GeoJSON file in a reprojected coordinate system
* a FBX file in a local coordinate system
* and a DWG file for AutoCAD containing only the center lines of the lanes

FME supports a [magnitude of formats](https://www.safe.com/fme/formats-matrix/) including glTF, OBJ and Unreal Datasmith.


## Custom Writers in r:tr√•n

Since the data model of OpenDRIVE is already implemented to a large extent, the functionality can be used to develop custom writers for other formats.
Take a look at the model, transformer and reader-writer module for doing so.
