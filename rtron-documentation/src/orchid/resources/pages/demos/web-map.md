# Web-Map-Client

The [3DCityDB Web-Map-Client](https://github.com/3dcitydb/3dcitydb-web-map) is a browser-based virtual globe built on top of [Cesium](https://cesium.com).

For this demo the overlapping lane geometries have been merged with FME.
Moreover, the objects have been colorized depending on their semantics and crowns have been added to the trees.

Take a look at the interactive [demo collection](https://wiki.tum.de/display/gisproject/Online+Demo+Collection) of the Chair of Geoinformatics at the TUM.
A Web-Map-Client can be deployed as [Docker container](https://github.com/tum-gis/3dcitydb-web-map-docker).
